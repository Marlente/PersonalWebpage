#Personal Webpage

##Contents
###Purpose
###Setup
###Further Development

##1. Purpose
This page is dedicated to mirror my personal development as well as to express my self and share stories and insights. Further building this page as a project helped me to learn coding in the first place. It's just the starting point as I plan to manage all kinds of things via this webpage.

##2. Setup
###Blog
Each blog post has a card in the basic blog.html page. Here I add tags, a reading time and a background picture to give a feeling about the content of the post. To read the full post the user will be linked to a dedicated html file just including the blogpost.

###Project Gallery
Similar to the blog each project in projectgallery.html gets a card with title and icon representing the project intension. To read more about the project I build a description modal that can be expanded/minimized. 

###About Me
This page is more creative and initially dedicated to my application for the Founders and Coders Bootcamp (content will be adapted afterwards). To present myself the page starts with 3 cards including a picture and an article describing me. For better flow I included some errors that only appear for certain screen sizes. This section is followed by a collection of citations, structured in '<div>' elements. Further I added the six projects I worked on in the mentioned application process as well as some walks of life I consider to be really important. For larger screens the elements are ordered in a 2-column grid, while smaler screen require to sort them one after another.

##3. Further Development
####Reusable HTML Components
The next immediate goal is to build reusable blocks probably with react.js for header, footer and later also cards for blog articles and projects. As I started with no knowledge I just built everything in HTML itself, whereas now I question the whole architecture of the project.

####Connect own domain
To boost motivation I initially bought my own domain (www.marlo-kuerner.com) it's another self-evident step to connect it while still hosting the page via GitHub Pages. 

####Expand Content
Furter I will continue to write blog articles as this is just fun from time to time. I plan to include a section for favorite books, podcasts and similar things.
