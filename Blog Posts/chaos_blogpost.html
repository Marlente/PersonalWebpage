                This picture is illustrating the movement of a relatively  simple construction: the double pendulum. The interesting thing is that you will never get the same swing pattern twice, no matter how precisely you try to reconstruct the initial conditions. 
                And scientists tried this really hard. In a chaotic world small things matter. One simple example to illustrate that is given by the double-pendulum. No matter how exact you try to reconstruct the initial conditions, you will never get the same swing pattern twice. 
                This means slightly different constrains in the beginning will inevitably lead to a different result in the end. We all know this phenomena by its popular scientific name - Butterfly Effect. 
                Another interesting property of this is the paradox of being determined but as the same time not predictable. My approach to deal with this is to allocate my resources in becoming a good decision maker.
