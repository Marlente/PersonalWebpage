                Once upon a time there were two, let's say young men, playing with sticks when something happened that should shape the future of both of them. The taller one of the little boys, 
                ironically with a debility of sight, should be the first to see it. A regular sized American football slowly floating down the nearby river. Smooth. Bucolic. Innocent. 
                Nobody will ever know where it came from, maybe the divine decided a football is going to entangle their fates for all times.

                When the boys saw the football they got really excited because well they were kids. So there was not a moment of hesitation to run to the river and get this ball out of there. 
                Call it luck or call it fate, without the sticks they would not be able to get it. Got it. First Touch! And now its time to make this story a bit more interesting, so why should two boys care so 
                much about this football? Right because its two boys and only one football. But to make it a more valuable asset a sudden inspiration lead them to give around the football in the whole scholar group 
                of the exchange program they participated. On the last day and also on the bus drive home everybody signed it, to make that football a unique souvenir. Fair enough the tall boy called the football his own, as he spotted it first. 
                But he lulled himself in a very false sense of security. Shortly before they arrived home hullabaloo and chaos emerged. He had lost it. As everybody signed it everybody was suspicious to be the thief, 
                that's what the other boy told him. With tears in the eyes he capitulated, going out of that bus a broken men. The waiting mother wondering what went wrong on that excursion. But in the moment they 
                drove away he turned around and it became crystal clear what happened. The other boy was raising the football into the blue sky like a trophy. Laughing. Crying. Flipping the bird. And thats how it started….
                <br>
                7 years later…
                Where are we today? The football changed possessors for more than 20 times including at least four holders having nothing to do with the story at all. One of the boys made calendars and albums showing the football and himself on 
                all kind of adventures. Football and him having dinner. Football and him going hiking. Football and him going on a plane. The other one bought a showcase, perfectly filling it with artificial turf just to up the ant. And that's just the tip of the iceberg! 
                Plots, longterm plans, bribes, occasions of trespass and plottwists - you could honestly make a movie about that crazy story. And one more thing, I mean its all over the town: Im the other guy. And I have it. The showcase is empty.
                <br>
                The moral of the story: <br>
                Keep your inner child alive. Just a little bit. Keep soul in the game, keep love in the game, keep fun in the game and it will eventually also improve your game of life.
