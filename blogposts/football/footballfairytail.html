                    <article>
                        Once upon a time there were two, let's say young men abroad in a exchange program, playing around with sticks when something happened that should shape the future for both of them. The taller one, 
                        ironically with a debility of sight, should be the first to see it. A regular sized American football slowly floating down the nearby river. Smooth. Bucolic. Innocent. 
                        Nobody will ever know where it came from, maybe the divine decided a football is going to entangle their fates for all times.
                        <h4 class="py-1 text-xl font-semibold">You can touch it, you can catch it</h4>
                        When the boys saw the football they got really excited, I mean they were kids. So there was not a moment of hesitation to run to the river and get the ball out of there. 
                        Call it luck or call it fate, without the sticks they would not be able to get it. Got it. <p class="font-semibold">First Touch!</p>
                        And now its time to make this story a bit more interesting, so why should two boys care so 
                        much about this football? Right because it's two of them but only one football. On the last day of the program everybody got to sign the football, to making it an unique souvenir. Fair enough the tall boy called the football his own, as he spotted it first. 
                        But he lulled himself in a very false sense of security. Shortly before they arrived home hullabaloo and chaos emerged. He had lost it. As everybody signed it short before, everybody was suspicious to be the thief. 
                        The bus arrived and no football could be found, so he left the bus with tears in his eyes. The awaiting mother wondering what went wrong on that excursion. But in the moment they 
                        drove away he turned around and it became crystal clear what happened. The other boy was raising the football into the blue sky like a trophy. Laughing. Crying. Flipping the bird. And that's just how it started….
                        <br>
                        <h4 class="py-1 text-xl font-semibold">7 years later...</h4>
                        Where are we today? The football changed possessors for more than 20 times including at least four guys having nothing to do with the story at all. 
                        The maturity of plans how to steal it back as well as security measurements significantly increased over time, including a lot of showing off from whoever was in possesion. One of the boys made calendars and albums showing the football and himself on 
                        all kind of adventures. Football and him having dinner. Football and him going hiking. Football and him going on a plane. The other one bought a showcase, perfectly filling it with artificial turf just to up the ant. And that's just the tip of the iceberg! 
                        Plots, longterm plans, bribes, occasions of trespass and intrigues - you could honestly make a movie about that story. And asa you may guess at this moment: Im the other guy. And I have it. The showcase is empty. And writing this lines is mainly motivated to stress that point.
                        <h4 class="py-1 text-xl font-semibold">The end?</h4>
                        I think there is no end, my grandchildren will keep stealing it from his descendants. My moral of the story: keep your inner child alive. Just a little bit.
