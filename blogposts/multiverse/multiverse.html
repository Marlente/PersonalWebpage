                        The multiverse theory is a fascinating concept that has been postulated by various physicists over the years and it suggests that our universe is not the only one out there, but rather, there are vast numbers of universes existing simultaneously.

                        The idea of the multiverse can be traced back to the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, which was proposed by physicist Hugh Everett in 1957. Everett suggested that the universe splits into multiple parallel universes every time a quantum measurement is made. In each universe, the result of the measurement is different, giving rise to different outcomes.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Deutsch's contribution to this theory is the idea that shadow photons are responsible for the interference phenomena witnessed in quantum mechanics. According to Deutsch, when a photon is emitted, it creates a vast number of "shadow" photons in parallel universes that interferes with the paths of the original photon. This interference is responsible for the wave-like behavior of particles and explains why single photons seem to “interfere with themselves”.
                        
                        In other words, shadow photons represent different universes in the multiverse, whereby they are not tangible and only interact with each other through interference. This concept is also known as the Many-Interacting-Worlds Interpretation (MIWI) of quantum mechanics. Deutsch argues that this provides a more complete picture and further derives an interesting approach to quantum computation.
                        <br><br>
                        From the Turing principle, Deutsch derived the compliance of a universal quantum computer with the physical laws, which is able to render or simulate all possible environments. Together with the multiverse theory, this leads to an approach to quantum computation where parallelization means distributing computations in a vast number of universes (over 10^50), getting the calculated results encoded in the interference phenomena.

                        To make this happen, the level of decoherence is essential. The level of decoherence refers to the means by which the quantum state of a system becomes entangled with its environment in an unintended way. Minimizing decoherence is therefore critical to contain the quantum state of superposition, effectively creating a subset of universes that are identical despite what happens within the quantum computer.

                        By entangling qubits, one can create complex quantum states that cannot be represented by classical bits. This can be used to make intractable tasks from the perspective of classical computers, indeed tractable. A good example of this is factorization, which involves finding the factors that multiply to the input number and is used in todays encryption. The whole security of this concept is based on the fact that finding the two 125-digit prime numbers factors for a given 250-digit number would take one million years (intractability). Quantum computers using the Shor algorithm theoretically can do the task in a matter of minutes.

                        Personally I found the work of David Deutsch stunning and the multiverse theory is a fascinating explanation in his concept of the fabric of reality. Quantum computing really has the potential to revolutionize various fields, from cryptography to drug design and materials science, but: nuclear fission for instance has it too, and since the 50’s the technology claims to be ready in 40 years…
