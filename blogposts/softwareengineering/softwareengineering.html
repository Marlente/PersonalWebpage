                <div class="flex pt-2">
                    <article class="text-gray-800 text-lg">
                        Software engineers are some of the most wanted people nowadays, at least in the tech-economical society. But just because a war significantly increases the demand for soldiers, this doesn’t mean you should want to become one. Apart from the demand that we relate with success and potential, I found other upsides that made me eventually shift my career into the software industry.

                        <h1 class="font-semibold pt-2">1. FREEDOM</h1> 
                        More and more occupations enable people to work at least partly remote. At the core of this trend is of course the software industry, where you do not need more than your laptop and a stable internet connection. Additionally, a large share of jobs in this sphere is project-based, hence you can also choose the content you going to work on. That of course works only if you’re good in what you’re doing but it promises more variety than the average job for sure. This degree of freedom enables you to design your personal, best-suited lifestyle concept, no matter if it is one worcation after another or a settled suburb family life. As we will see later there are even more aspects of software engineering helping you to build the life you want to have.
                        
                        <h1 class="font-semibold pt-2">2.	CREATIVITY</h1>
                        How many products do you use which do not contain any software? And it will only get more, one could assume that an interior craftsman in 2042 may only design virtual living rooms. We witness an exponential rise in the share of software-based products what enables you as a software engineer to invent, design and build a complete product with almost no investment costs despite your time. The act of creation goes hand in hand with an attainment of creativity and self-realization, the highest needs in Maslow’s hierarchy. The most valuable good we can trade are ideas and there is no better space to develop them.
                        
                        <h1 class="font-semibold pt-2">3.	LEVERAGE & SCALE</h1>
                        Being an entrepreneur 200 years ago must be hard, as the only two available levers were capital and labor, both requiring some form of permission. You need trust, a reputation, or rich parents to gain the resources for scaling your ideas. The modern world is fundamentally different in that manner, anyone with access to the internet gains access to the largest audience there is ever since, and you don’t need to ask your parents for allowance. Further every software engineer can have millions of employees, namely bots in servers around the globe working day and night in a cheap and reliable way. This leverage allows you to change the proportionality between your time and your rewards. Make the 4-hour work week happen if you want to.
                        
                        <h1 class="font-semibold pt-2">4.	THE RISE OF AI</h1>
                        Artificial intelligence is on the edge to surpass humans and progress is made every single day. We do not know if this is for good or bad, but for now it just seems inevitable. In terms of intelligence the human share of the total existing intelligence will therefore shrink. The three simplified scenarios can be either controlling AI and use it for accomplishing human goals vs. empowered AI gets rid of humans vs. a merge of both species to some cyborgs. Anyways I feel the urge to better understand software and it is probably the most interesting and dynamical frontier of technology in human history. 
                        
                        <h1 class="font-semibold pt-2">5.	CHALLENGE	</h1>
                        Okay frankly this is not unique there are complicated quests to solve in every endeavor but computing and algorithms provide a unique tool to solve such quests. How to launch a rocket? How to realize a smart grid? How to let a car drive itself? Without sophisticated algorithms (and AI) we could not solve these problems. Therefore, the scale of complexity one can handle increases drastically with the power to build those systems. Sounds appealing to me.

                        Of course this is a biased view, as I am a technology enthusiast but I put some thoughts into that before deciding to follow this path. Happy if it helps you finding yours.
