                        The idea of morphic fields was initially proposed by Rupert Sheldrake, and suggests that there is a 
                        dimension that connects all living beings and resonates with their natural frequency. This dimension is 
                        said to contain a collective memory or information about the form and behavior of living things, and it is 
                        thought to be responsible for the seemingly instinctual behavior of organisms. These fields are deeply 
                        connected to evolution, as trial and error is the predominant mechanism of knowledge creation. The concept of 
                        morphic fields has indeed been met with skepticism in the scientific community, but the fundamental concept is 
                        not new at all. In ancient Greece, philosophies of form fell into two main categories. Following Plato, the 
                        forms of living organisms were seen as imperfect copies of transcendent archetypes, or ideal Forms. His student 
                        Aristotle thought that the forms of animals and plants were shaped by their souls, which contained the form of 
                        the body and attracted the developing organism towards the characteristic form of its species. Nowadays the 
                        mechanic school is predominant, for example the idea of epigenetics has been used to explain how plants and 
                        animals can inherit certain traits from that hardcoded DNS information. If so nature has developed impressive 
                        features for data compression… 
        
                        <br> <br>
                        <p class="font-semibold">But let us speculate a little further: </p>what other information might be passed down through morphic fields? 
                            And what implications does this have for our understanding of reality and our place in the world? <br> <br>
        
                        One possibility is that morphic fields could provide a link between organisms that is not based on genetics or physical proximity. 
                        It could connect us all on a deeper level, creating a sense of interconnectedness that transcends the physical world. 
                        This could have important implications for our understanding of consciousness, as well as our sense of self and our 
                        relationship to the natural world. Quantum entanglement could even create links not affected by space-time as we understand it.
                        Another thought is that morphic fields could provide a way for organisms to evolve more quickly and adapt to changing environments. 
                        If certain traits are passed down through morphic fields rather than genetics, it could allow for faster evolution and greater adaptability 
                        independent from the location. <br> <br>
                        While the concept of morphic fields is still largely speculative, it is an intriguing idea that 
                        has the potential to connect us all on a deeper level and change the way we think about reality. It will be interesting 
                        to see how research in this area develops and what new insights it may bring to our understanding of the world. 
                        Let me close with this: <br> <br>
        
                        <p class="font-semibold">All self-organizing systems are wholes made up of parts, which are themselves wholes at a lower level. 
                            Further the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and I think there are mechanisms working on every plane of life, 
                            just that it is not like the classic career ladder, and you cannot work your way up, or can you?</p>
