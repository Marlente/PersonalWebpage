                        <br>
                        The idea that cultural knowledge can shape our decisions and ultimately shape the course of history is a fascinating one. 
                        It is hard to imagine how different our world would be if certain historical events had played out differently. 
                        For example, if Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code" is more than a book, and things would have gone differently then maybe 
                        masochism and feminism would switch roles.  <br> <br>
                        One underlaying mechanism here is the concept of cultural transmission, the process by which cultural knowledge is passed 
                        down from one generation to the next. Cultural transmission can take many forms, such as through language, art, and rituals. 
                        Understanding those forms is not so far from science as we sometimes tend to think. It impresses me to dig into sayings, 
                        and how deep there meaning can be setting it into context. It's through this process that 
                        cultural knowledge is accumulated and shared, shaping the way we think, feel and behave.
                        <br> <br>
                        If Jesus had a wife, and we acknowledge it, it's certain that the role of women in Christianity would be different. The Catholic Church's 
                        teaching on celibacy would have been different, and the status of marriage as well. The editing process of the single most important book 
                        would have taken another course. All of these changes would have had a thorough effect on history, shaping the way people live and 
                        interact with one another. With the so-called Lindsay-Effect, Nassim Taleb points out that for certain immaterial things the 
                        life-expectancy grows proportional to the lifespan, so it is far from easy to change the foundations of those ideas as we are 
                        not even aware of how much they impact us. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that cultural knowledge is not fixed, but 
                        always evolving. It is shaped by the people who transmit it and the people who receive it. Modern times seem to destabilize the 
                        knowledge transmission over generations, as information consumption changed rapidly.

                        <p class="font-semibold">The impact of cultural knowledge is not always visible, but it's always present,</p> 
                        influencing the way we think, feel, and behave. It's a fascinating subject to think about, and it's 
                        important to understand how it shapes the course of history and how it affects our daily lives.
