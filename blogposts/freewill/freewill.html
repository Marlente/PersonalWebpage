                        In a fully deterministic universe everything would be predictable, so thinking about free will we have 
                        to ensure the future is not carved in stone. More scientifically this requires that actual information 
                        is something that increases over time, and my best guess where new information could originate is quantum 
                        mechanics. It is as simple a measuring the position of an electron: in beforehand we can only predict 
                        probabilities where we will find it. Therefore afterwards, we do know something we could not have known 
                        before (although Einstein did not like this randomness). Another argumentation is connecting information to 
                        the increasing entropy in our universe and leads to the same conclusion but takes us too far for 409 words. 
                        For now, we have concluded two things: that information is not steady but increasing, and that quantum 
                        events can be connected to the generation of this new information (bad news for LaPlaces Demon…). 
                        <br> <br>
                        Where 
                        it gets speculative is when we think about how this quantum measurements could be connected to our 
                        decision-making. Let us quickly introduce the concept of superposition: before we conduct a measurement, 
                        any quantum system can have multiple states at the same time. Like a qubit in quantum computer representing 
                        zero and one at once. Bringing it back to real life this means that there are a vast number of possible 
                        histories and possible futures for every event before it happens. We cannot proof it, but how amazing would 
                        it be if our free will can affect which path we choose through this infinite pattern of possibilities? 
                        To me that is a powerful thought to strengthen my belief in self-determination and further: 
                        <p class="font-semibold">EVERYTHING is 
                        then possible.</p>
                        <br>
                         The whole process of life is so much more fascinating if I am the master of my fate, the 
                        captain of my soul. But indeed, a quantum measurement and a macroscopic real-life event are two different 
                        pairs of shoes. How could things on the scale of quantum physics possibly effect things like human behaviour? 
                        One stunning thing I came across is the sensitive dependency on initial conditions, a feature we call chaos. 
                        Like the so-called butterfly effect states: the tiniest deviation in the set of initial conditions results in 
                        totally different behaviour of any chaotic system in the long term. 
                        <br>
                        To finally answer the question: yes, I do 
                        like to think that free will exists.
