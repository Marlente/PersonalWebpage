                        I always found Quantum mechanics to be a mind-bending realm of science that defies our everyday experience in the physical world. Nonetheless it is currently the most powerful explanatory framework to make sense of the perceived fabric of reality. One of the most fascinating phenomena in quantum mechanics is entanglement. In short, entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become connected in such a way that their states affect each other instantaneously, no matter how far apart they are. When one particle's state is measured, if forces the whole entangled wave function to collapse, and all particles will take on a definite state. This is what Einstein famously called
                        <p class="font-semibold">"spooky action at a distance."</p> 
                        <br> <br>
                        I went down a rabbit hole with this when thinking about an interplanetary warning system. With a friend I imagined that we have two entangled particles, one on Earth and one on Mars. Now we would somehow manipulate Earth’s particle to collapse its wave function into a specific state, and the Mars particle's wave function would collapse into the corresponding state instantaneously. The thought was that the collapse itself could be witnessed on Mars and therefore could carry information, effectively sending a message in real-time.
                        <br> <br>                       
                        But we knew there must be a catch, as Einstein's laws of relativity forbid the transfer of information faster than the speed of light. And while the entangled particles are indeed connected, no information is actually being transmitted when the entangled quantum state collapses. It is just so that Earth would now something about the state of the particle on Mars, but this information was stored already in the wave function and is tangled to the particle that obviously cannot travel faster than light.
                        <br>
                        So, unfortunately, we can't use this strange and wonderful phenomena for faster-than-light communication or for creating an interplanetary warning system. Still it is a crucial characteristic next to superposition and quantum tunneling that is taken advantage of in quantum computing.
